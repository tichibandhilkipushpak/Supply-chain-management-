Blockchain can enable more transparent and accurate end-to-end tracking in the supply chain: 
Organizations can digitize physical assets and create a decentralized immutable record of all transactions, making it possible to track assets from production to delivery or use by end user.
In this supply chain contractwe can track the item when it is created/paid/delivered this ensures that there is no middle man and hence is the reliable source of truth.
Whenever item is paid or delivered we emit the event and it is stored on the transaction log this logs are stored in the blockchain's block.
